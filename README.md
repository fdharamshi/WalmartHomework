## Backend
A minimal service for backend is created using Flask.
It returns static data everytime.

Endpoints:

#### Spin Up the backend:
- Make sure flask is installed on the system.
- `python3 app.py`
- This runs on port `1234`

## Frontend
Frontend was created using React.js
Styling was completely done using CSS
Libraries used: `react-router-dom` & `react-icons`

#### Spin Up the Frontend:
- Run `npm install`
- Make sure backend is on the same machine as this communicates over localhost
- Run `npm start` to run the frontend. This will run on port `3000`
